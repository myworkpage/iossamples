Hi Wayne,

I hope you're doing well!

I’m reaching out to ask if you could assist us with updating the environment variables for the Android Keystore password in the CI/CD pipeline. Both Tom and I don’t have the necessary permissions to make these updates ourselves, and we need the Keystore password to be set as bcbsla@1234.

Would you be able to help with this? Let us know if you need any additional details.
